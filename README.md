Terraris Online Map Viewer
==========================

** THIS IS IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT **

A Javascript and HTML5 online map viewer for Terraria WLD files

To try this out, visit http://njt1982.github.io/terraria-online-map-viewer/ and select a .wld file from Terraria.


Currently this only reads files - it doesn't write anything. There should be no harm done to any of your world files.

DISCLAIMER: I hold no responsibility for anything that goes wrong with them.
